# Python Keylogger

This is a simple keylogger implemented in Python using the `pynput` library. It listens for keyboard events and logs the pressed keys into a file called `keylogger.txt`. The keylogger captures regular keystrokes, special keys like Enter, Backspace, Tab, and Space, and stops when the Escape key is pressed.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library (`pip install pynput`)

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script: `python keylogger.py`.
3. Keystrokes will be saved in `keylogger.txt`.
